Grading Help FileNames: Akul Kapoor, Matt Powell-PalmAndrew ID’s: akulk, mpowellpRequired Elements:1. JavaScript/Objects w/Inheritance: While we make use of JavaScript throughout our program, an example of object inheritance can be found when we make the particles for our little search button explosion, around line 511 of the js file, in which coloredParticle inherits from Particle.2. Canvas – While it pretty much killed us to include a canvas in what we thought was an otherwise snazzed-out project, we use it to add some meaningful panache to our searches: when you click search, YAAAAAAAAAY, explosion of glowy particles. Brandon’s idea. Examples around line 527 of the js file. 3. HTML – Just take a look at our HTML file and work should be evident. We’ve got unsorted lists, we source audio files, we use forms for searching, the works. Every line is an example line.4. CSS – Similarly, our application of CSS is pretty encompassing. An example of a nice smooth transition can be found around line 40, where we make our search bars extend and contract. And when you click on a picture from the list…. izz niiice, right?5. DOM Manipulation – We manipulate the DOM left and right, all throughout our js. An example can be found when we populate our list of Similar Artists by appending them to divs which we append to other divs. Example around line 425. 6. AJAX – Our most important/trickiest use of AJAX can be found in the accessing of our EchoNest API, around line 226.7. jQuery – jQuery is also used just about everywhere in the js file, and our media player is a jQuery plugin, jPlayer. Examples everywhere, try around line 80.
